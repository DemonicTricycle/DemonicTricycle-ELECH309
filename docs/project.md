# Project Goal
This project was carried out in the context of the ELEC-H309 Projet Intégré course at the [École Polytechnique de Bruxelles (ULB)](https://polytech.ulb.be/en).  
Its purpose is to implement a sound operated robot control system. An acquisition chain had to be designed, as well as a motor regulation from encoders.  

# Methodology

## Specifications Analysis
This project is defined around a set of given specifications, these are:

- a
- b
- c
- ...

...

## Breakdown into Modules
We want to divide the project into multiple modules, each responsible for a part of the robot operation. The project consists of three main components:

- Data transmission over audio
- Logic processing of the received data
- Motor regulation to execute the command

This breakdown will ease the writing of each module's code, and improve its readability and access for developpers and integrators. It will also facilitate the processing optimization that can be done in order to stay within the limits of our microcontroller.

## Testing Strategies of Each Module
During the separate development of each module, we want to test their function and experiment with different parameters.

## Assembly of Modules
When every module has been thoroughly tested and fine tuned, as well as confirmed working, we can proceed with assembling all of them into a single program which will be written onto the microcontroller. Each module should be able to communicate with the other ones seamlessly.

## Final Testing and Results

# Conclusion
In the end, we have a fully functionning robot can that be controlled over sound from a user's device. This robot should be accurate and precise wihtin our defined margins, and be easily reproduced by others (with the same hardware).
