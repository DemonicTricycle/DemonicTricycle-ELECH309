# [`tools.c`](https://github.com/DemonicTricycle/DemonicTricycle-ELECH309/blob/main/src/tools.c)
We combined common code that was used generally into a [tools.c](https://github.com/DemonicTricycle/DemonicTricycle-ELECH309/blob/main/src/tools.c) file. It contains:

- UART functions (initialization, send message, send int, break line, etc)
- Integer conversions (unsigned to signed, unsigned to char array, etc)
- Absolute value of an int or float
